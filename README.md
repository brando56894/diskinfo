### Disk Info

This is just a basic Go app which lists indentifying information for the attached SCSI, SATA and NVME drives such as the World Wide Name (WWN), Device Name (sda, sdb, sdc, etc...), Model, and Serial Number.

It's a conversion of my Bash script (which is in the *stuff* repo) that I wrote a while ago to make managing my ZFS pools easier without a WebUI (like Cockpit or TrueNAS), but has more flexibility.
